abstract = {We propose a multi-user Mixed Reality (MR) telepresence system that allows users to interact by seamlessly visualizing remote environments and avatars overlaid onto their local physical space. Building on prior shared-space approaches, our method first aligns overlapping rooms to maximize a shared space–a common area containing matched real and virtual objects where all users can interact. Uniquely, our system extends beyond this shared space by visualizing non-shared spaces, the remaining part of each room, allowing users to inhabit these distinct areas. To address the issue of overlap between non-shared spaces, we dynamically adjust their visibility based on user proximity, using a Voronoi diagram to prioritize subspaces closer to each user. Visualizing the surrounding space of each user conveys spatial context, helping others interpret their behavior within their environment. Visibility is updated in real time as users move, maintaining a coherent sense of spatial awareness. Through a user study, we demonstrate that our system enhances enjoyment, spatial understanding, and presence compared to shared-space-only approaches. Quantitative results further show that our dynamic visibility modulation improves both personal space preservation and space accessibility relative to static methods. Overall, our system provides users with a seamless, dynamically connected, and shared multi-room environment. We provide an system overview and demo video of our work in the supplementary material.},
